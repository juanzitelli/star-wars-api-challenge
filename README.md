# Summary

For the challenge that was proposed to me about making an API related to Star Wars, I used the proposed technologies such as TypeScript, Nest.js and TDD. To run the application you need two things: a PosgreSQL database running locally and then this Nest application. The steps to build the project are detailed below.

## Setup

### 0. Clone the repository down to your machine

Run `git clone git@github.com:juanzitelli/star-wars-api-challenge.git` to clone the repository using SSH.

### 0.5 Recommended package manager and Node.js

Before starting, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine by running `node -v` on your terminal. If it's not installed I suggest you use a very cool Node version manager called `fnm` [https://github.com/Schniz/fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and follow the instructions to get the node version specified in `/.nvmrc` installed and available on your machine.

Secondly, I suggest you use `pnpm` as the package manager to interact with the project. After you have node installed you can run `npm install -g pnpm` to install it. Whatever other package manager you prefer is fine as well.

### 1. Environment

There's a .env.sample file located at `/.env.sample` that you can use as reference for creating your own `.env` file containing the three required values:

```yaml
- PORT=3000 # The port the application will use to run
- DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:abc123@localhost:5432/postgres?schema=public" # REQUIRED: This is the connection string Prisma will use to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- SWAPI_URL="https://swapi.dev/api" # External API required for spawning random enemies
```

### 2. PostgreSQL database

This step requires you to setup a local `PostgreSQL` database. There's many different approaches to get this done but the easiest one is definitely using Docker. To achieve this do the following:

1. If you haven't got it installed on your machine already, download and install `Docker` from their official website: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Follow the instructions the website provides and make sure it's installed and running on your device.
3. If you installed it correctly, you should be able to run the following command to setup a `PostgreSQL` database locally:
   1. `docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=abc123 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`.
      1. `postgres-db` will be the name of the Docker container that holds the database.
      2. `abc123` will be the password that you then need to pass into the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
      3. `5432` will be the port from which you will connect to the db engine.
4. You then should be able to see the container running either using Docker Desktop (available to you after docker is installed) or the CLI tools (`docker ps -a`)

### 3. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the project using `pnpm`

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### 4. Pushing the schema to the recently created postgres-db database

In your terminal, cd into the project folder and run `pnpm prisma:push` to push the Prisma schema to the recently created `PostgreSQL` database.

### 5. Seeding the database

In your terminal, run `pnpm prisma:seed` to push the `Prisma` schema to the recently created database to insert some test data to play around with the API.

### 6. Run tests

I suggest you run tests to make sure the project's working fine using the following command

```bash
$ pnpm test
# or to run them in watch mode
$ pnpm test -- --watch 
```

### 7. Run the project

You can either run it in "production" or "dev" mode. Here are the commands for each mode.

```bash
# Production mode
$ pnpm build && pnpm start 

# Dev mode
$ pnpm dev
```

### 8. Navigate to the GraphQL playground

If you set everything up correctly you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphql` (make sure the port matches the port you specified in the PORT environment variable) and see a GraphQL playground to mess around with the API.

### 9. Copy demo queries into the playground

I've provided with several queries for you to copy and paste into the playground in `/src/queries.gql`.
